> A Trie is a tree-based data structure that organizes information in a hierarchy.

Properties: 
- It is typically used to store or search strings in a space and time efficient way. 
- Any node in trie can store non repetitive multiple characters 
- Every node stores link of the next character of the string 
- Every node keeps track of'end of string'

### Step 1: Define the Trie Node
Each node in a trie generally contains
- An array or map of child nodes representing the subsequent characters.
- A boolean flag to indicate whether this node represents the end of a valid word.

### Step 2: Define the Trie
Now, we define the trie itself, which will manage the root node and provide methods to **insert, search**, and **start with** (used for prefix searches).

### Concept of Deleting from a Trie
When deleting a word from a trie, you need to consider the following:
1. **Word Presence**: Check if the word is actually present in the trie.
2. **Shared Prefix**: Determine if the word shares prefixes with other words.
3. **Leaf Node**: Check if the node at the end of the word is a leaf node (i.e., it has no children).
4. **Removal of Non-Shared Nodes**: If nodes created exclusively for the word do not serve other words, they should be removed to free up space.


### Step 3: Test Your Trie
```Java

```

### Explanation:
1. **Insertion**: Converts each character to an index (0-25) and navigates or creates nodes accordingly.
2. **Search**: Traverses the trie according to the character sequence of the word. It returns true only if it finds the sequence and the final node is marked as the end of a word.
3. **StartsWith**: Similar to search, but only checks for the presence of the prefix nodes, regardless of whether they terminate a word.
