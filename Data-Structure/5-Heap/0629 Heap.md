# What is Heap?
> A heap is a complete binary tree that satisfies specific conditions and can be mainly divided into two types.

- Min heap: The value of any node ≤ the values of its child nodes.
- Max heap: The value of any node ≥ the values of its child nodes.

As a special case of a complete binary tree, heaps have the following characteristics:
- The bottom layer nodes are filled from left to right, and nodes in other layers are fully filled.
- The root node of the binary tree is called the "heap top," and the bottom-rightmost node is called the "heap bottom."
- For max heaps (min heaps), the value of the heap top element (root node) is the largest (smallest).

## Common operations on heaps
|Method name|Description|Time complexity|
|---|---|---|
|`push()`|Add an element to the heap|𝑂(log⁡𝑛)|
|`pop()`|Remove the top element from the heap|𝑂(log⁡𝑛)|
|`peek()`|Access the top element (for max/min heap, the max/min value)|𝑂(1)|
|`size()`|Get the number of elements in the heap|𝑂(1)|
|`isEmpty()`|Check if the heap is empty|𝑂(1)|

In practice, we can directly use the heap class (or priority queue class) provided by programming languages.

## Implementation of heaps
>The following implementation is of a max heap.
### 1.   Storage and representation of heaps
- As mentioned in the "Binary Trees" section, complete binary trees are well-suited for array representation. Since heaps are a type of complete binary tree, **we will use arrays to store heaps**.
- When using an array to represent a binary tree, elements represent node values, and indexes represent node positions in the binary tree. **Node pointers are implemented through an index mapping formula**.
- As shown in Figure 8-2, given an index 𝑖, the index of its left child is 2𝑖+1, the index of its right child is 2𝑖+2, and the index of its parent is (𝑖−1)/2 (floor division). When the index is out of bounds, it signifies a null node or the node does not exist.
