# What is Greedy?
Greedy algorithmÂ is a common algorithm for solving optimization problems, which fundamentally involves making the seemingly best choice at each decision-making stage of the problem, i.e., greedily making locally optimal decisions in hopes of finding a globally optimal solution. Greedy algorithms are concise and efficient, and are widely used in many practical problems.

Greedy algorithms and dynamic programming are both commonly used to solve optimization problems. They share some similarities, such as relying on the property of optimal substructure, but they operate differently.

- Dynamic programming considers all previous decisions at the current decision stage and uses solutions to past subproblems to construct solutions for the current subproblem.
- Greedy algorithms do not consider past decisions; instead, they proceed with greedy choices, continually narrowing the scope of the problem until it is solved.
